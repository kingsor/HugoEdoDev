Very interesting post by [Jacopo Romei](https://jacoporomei.com/) on Linkedin.

[Do You Know Wittgenstein's Ruler?](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jacoporomei_do-you-use-wittgensteins-ruler-wittgenstein-activity-7191725160930938882-oqZT/)

I quote it here as a note to self.

> Do You Know Wittgenstein's Ruler?

> Wittgenstein, the philosopher, posed an intriguing question: If you buy a ruler but have no tool to measure its accuracy, how can you be sure the ruler is precise?

> You'd have to use the ruler itself, or another similar ruler, thus falling into a trap of endless—and flawed—self-verifications.

> You MUST find a different tool to check the accuracy of your ruler.

> Most people have only one 'ruler' at their disposal when negotiating a contract or a collaboration: time.

> Time is the only measure by which people decide whether they have been paid well, poorly, too much, or too little.

> Unfortunately, this leads people to make terrible decisions: 'Well, it took me three hours, I can't possibly ask for $800!' or 'You finished quicker than expected, how about I pay you less?' And people accept this because they lack other tools to evaluate their work and the value they produce. 

> Not knowing how to measure what they want, they end up wanting what they can measure.

> Wittgenstein would have been upset.

> But if you are interested, there are many other ways to negotiate collaborations, using a different ruler, not that of time, but that of value, to generate more satisfaction for yourself, the customer, and anyone else involved in the negotiation.

> I talk about it in Extreme Contracts.
