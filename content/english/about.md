I am a professional with a complete vision of the life cycle of a digital product. I work completely independently, collaborating with teams to create products that combine technology and value for users.

With solid technical skills (.NET Core, C#, Azure, Clean Code) and a broad vision of the creation process, I accompany companies from idea to realization, ensuring scalable and user-centered results.

I bring advanced technical skills (.NET Core, C#, Azure, Clean Code) integrated with a strategic vision of the digital product life cycle. In addition to software development, I focus on architecture, process optimization and collaboration with multidisciplinary teams to create effective and scalable digital experiences.

I work as a full remote freelancer.
