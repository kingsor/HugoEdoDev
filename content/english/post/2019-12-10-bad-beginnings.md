based on [Starting with failure is good for creativity, as long as you get started](https://qz.com/424461/the-three-most-destructive-words-in-the-english-language/)

> The first beginning will feel wrong. We are not used to being with ourselves uninterrupted. We do not know the way first things look. We have imagined our creations finished but never begun. A thing begun is less right than wrong, more flaw than finesse, all problem and no solution. Nothing begins good, but everything good begins. *Everything can be revised, erased, or rearranged later. The courage of creation is making bad beginnings.*

> Good writing is bad writing well edited; a good hypothesis is whatever is left after many experiments fail; good cooking is the result of choosing, chopping, skinning, shelling, and reducing; a great movie has as much to do with what ends up on the cutting room floor as what does not.

> To succeed in the art of new, we must fail freely and frequently. The empty canvas must not stay empty. We have to plunge into it.
